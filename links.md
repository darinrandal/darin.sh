Here's a list of some of my other websites that I've made. Most are unfinished but I'm committing to getting them all updated and looking snazzy. If you want to more information about any of them, check out my main portfolio website listed first below.

- [darinrandal.com](https://darinrandal.com) - My main Portfolio website. Currently a WIP as you might notice.
- [darin.sh](https://darin.sh) - My little hacker blog which you're on right now.
- [erppy.co](https://erppy.co) - A gorgeous WebGL visualizer that I play some music to.
- [cudi.zone](https://cudi.zone) - A silly shoutout to Kid Cudi and his song Cudi Zone. The audio is currently broken. I'll get it fixed soon.
- [poe.fish](https://poe.fish) - Path of Exile Fishing Wiki built on wiki.js. I'm going to be migrating this over to Pages and Jekyll soon. Read more [here](https://darin.sh/cloudflare-pages-and-jamstack).
- [poefishing.com](https://poefishing.com) - Currently just used as redirect to poe.fish. Might do something with it down the road.
- [github](https://github.com/darinrandal) - Can't forget my GitHub. There's not as much on here as I'd like. I'm planning on getting more projects listed on here too.
