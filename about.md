## Hey, I'm Darin

This is my hacker-style blog where I write about projects and technology pretty much solely. I was able to grab darin.sh so figured this would be a perfect choice for it.
I basically live in terminals and have wrote an unfathomable amount of shell scripts so here we are. Enjoy the content. I'll try to update at least monthly. Hopefully more often.


If you're interested in seeing my professional portfolio and less techy posts you can check out: [darinrandal.com](https://darinrandal.com). You'll find all my various links and contact information over there.
